// FontStack -- this GUI's two typefaces, loaded with FreeType and wrapped as Cairo font faces.
//
// Ported from the rations-amp plug-in editor, which is where the ownership rule below was worked
// out and written down. Michroma is the title face and Roboto the body face, so the window reads
// as part of the same family.
//
// THE OWNERSHIP RULE, which is the whole reason this class exists rather than a pair of
// cairo_ft_font_face_create_for_ft_face() calls at the call site: the FT_Face, the bytes behind it
// and the FT_Library are owned by the cairo_font_face_t, through a destroy callback. Never call
// FT_Done_Face on them. fontstack.cpp explains what goes wrong if you do.
//
// If a face fails to load, the fallback is a generic Cairo toy face of the same weight, so text
// still renders (one warning on stderr, then silence).
