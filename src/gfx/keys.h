// The editing keys, named without reference to X11.

// src/gfx/ links cairo and nothing else -- that is what lets tools/uirender compose and audit
// the real panel with no X server running, and it stops being true the moment a widget needs
// XK_BackSpace. So the window translates a KeySym into one of these (platform/keymap.h) and the
// widgets never see an X type.
//
// Text is carried separately, as UTF-8 bytes, because a keystroke can produce both (Return) or
// neither (a bare Shift) or text with no editing key at all (any ordinary character, and every
// character that arrives from a dead-key or Compose sequence).

    // not care that this is a scoped enumeration -- `Key::None` expands to `Key::0L` in every
    // translation unit that has seen an X header, which is every one that translates a
    // keysym. The collision is written down in this project's rules as a known hazard rather
    // than something to rediscover; this is the rediscovery it was written down to prevent.
