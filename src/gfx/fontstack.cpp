// Everything a cairo font face needs to keep alive for as long as CAIRO says,
// not for as long as the FontStack that created it says. Attached to the face
// as user data, so cairo frees it when it drops its last internal reference.
//
// This is not belt-and-braces. cairo caches font faces and scaled fonts in
// process-wide tables, and the ft backend keys its cache on the FT_Face
// POINTER (cairo-ft-font.c, _cairo_ft_unscaled_font_keys_equal), holding the
// entry alive after cairo_font_face_destroy() returns. Calling FT_Done_Face()
// there — as this class used to — leaves that cache entry pointing at freed
// memory, and the next FT_New_Memory_Face() to be handed the same address (a
// second plug-in window, or the same one reopened) silently inherits the dead
// entry: its cached cairo font face, its scaled fonts and its already
// rasterised glyphs. The visible result is text drawn with another face's or
// another size's glyphs — a few characters at a time, intermittently, until
// the editor is recreated at a different address. cairo documents the rule on
// cairo_ft_font_face_create_for_ft_face(): "You must not call FT_Done_Face()
// before the last reference to the cairo_font_face_t has been dropped", and
// prescribes exactly this user-data callback as the way to obey it.
